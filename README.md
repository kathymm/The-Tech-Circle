Introduction
How the Internet Works
The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate through a standardized set of protocols. When you visit a website, several steps happen behind the scenes to deliver the web page to your browser.

Your Computer (Client): You open a web browser and type a URL (e.g., www.example.com) into the address bar.

DNS Lookup: The URL is translated into an IP address by the Domain Name System (DNS), which is like the internet's phone book.

Request Sent: Your browser sends a request to the server hosting the website using the IP address obtained from the DNS.

Server Response: The server processes the request and sends back the requested web page.

Rendering the Page: Your browser receives the data and renders the web page on your screen.

Diagram
Here's a simplified diagram to illustrate this process:

lua

Copy code

+--------------+ +-------------+ +------------+

| | | | | |

| Your Browser | <------> | DNS Server | <------> | Web Server |

| | | | | |

+--------------+ +-------------+ +------------+

Your Browser: Sends a request for a web page.

DNS Server: Translates the URL to an IP address.

Web Server: Hosts the website and responds to the request with the web page data.

Why Python?
Python is a popular programming language for several reasons:

Easy to Learn: Python's syntax is clear and resembles English, making it an excellent choice for beginners.

Versatile: Python is used in various fields, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more.

Large Community: Python has a vast and active community, providing plenty of resources, libraries, and frameworks to help you in your projects.

High Demand: Python developers are in high demand, with many job opportunities in different industries.

Average Earnings of Python Programmers
Understanding the financial benefits of learning Python can be motivating. Here's a breakdown of average earnings based on experience:

Entry-level Python Developers: $60,000 - $80,000 per year

Mid-level Python Developers: $80,000 - $120,000 per year

Senior-level Python Developers: $120,000+ per year

These figures can vary based on factors like location, industry, and specific skills.

Setting Up the Development Environment
Step 1: Installing Python
Visit the official Python website.

Download the latest version of Python.

Run the installer and follow the instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".

Step 2: Setting Up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Download and install VS Code.

Open VS Code and install the Python extension from the Extensions marketplace.

Writing Your First Python Program
Let's start with a simple program to ensure everything is set up correctly.

Open VS Code.

Create a new file and save it with a .py extension, for example, hello.py.

Write the following code:
python
Copy code
print("Hello, world!")

Save the file and run it. In VS Code, you can run the file by right-clicking in the editor and selecting "Run Python File in Terminal".

You should see Hello, world! printed in the terminal.

Basic Syntax and Variables
Variables
Variables are used to store data. Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable.

python

Copy code

Variables
name = "Alice"

age = 25

height = 5.5

print(name) # Output: Alice

print(age) # Output: 25

print(height) # Output: 5.5

Data Types
Python has several built-in data types:

Numeric Types: int, float

String Type: str

Boolean Type: bool

python

Copy code

Numeric Types
x = 10 # int

y = 3.14 # float

String Type
greeting = "Hello, world!"

Boolean Type
is_python_fun = True

print(type(x)) # Output: <class 'int'>

print(type(y)) # Output: <class 'float'>

print(type(greeting)) # Output: <class 'str'>

print(type(is_python_fun)) # Output: <class 'bool'>

Basic Input/Output Operations
Output
The print() function is used to display output.

python

Copy code

Output
print("Hello, world!") # Output: Hello, world!

print("My name is", name) # Output: My name is Alice

print("I am", age, "years old") # Output: I am 25 years old
Input
The input() function is used to take user input. It returns the input as a string.

python

Copy code

Input
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

print("Hello,", user_name)
Basic Arithmetic Operations
Python supports basic arithmetic operations:

Addition: +

Subtraction: -

Multiplication: *

Division: /

python

Copy code

Arithmetic Operations
a = 10

b = 3



sum = a + b

difference = a - b

product = a * b

quotient = a / b

  

print("Sum:", sum) # Output: Sum: 13

print("Difference:", difference) # Output: Difference: 7

print("Product:", product) # Output: Product: 30

print("Quotient:", quotient) # Output: Quotient: 3.3333333333333335
Project: Simple Calculator
Project Description
We'll create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Prompt the user for two numbers and an operation.

Perform the operation based on user input.

Display the result.

Code Example
python

Copy code

Simple Calculator
Getting user input
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))

num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
Getting the operation choice from the user
print("Select operation: \n1. Add\n2. Subtract\n3. Multiply\n4. Divide")

choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4): ")
Performing the operation
if choice == '1':

result = num1 + num2

print(f"The result of {num1} + {num2} is {result}")

elif choice == '2':

result = num1 - num2

print(f"The result of {num1} - {num2} is {result}")

elif choice == '3':

result = num1 * num2

print(f"The result of {num1} * {num2} is {result}")

elif choice == '4':

if num2 != 0:

result = num1 / num2

print(f"The result of {num1} / {num2} is {result}")

else:

print("Error! Division by zero.")

else:

print("Invalid input")
Explanation
We use input() to get user input and float() to convert it to a floating-point number.

We print a menu for the user to select an operation.

We use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to perform the chosen operation and display the result.

Tomorrow, we'll delve deeper into control structures like conditional statements and loops. We'll also build a fun number guessing game. Make sure to practice today's concepts to reinforce your learning.

Feel free to ask any questions you might have or discuss any issues you faced today. See you tomorrow!

Day 2: Control Structures
Introduction
Control structures are essential in programming as they control the flow of execution based on certain conditions or repeatedly execute a block of code. Today, we'll cover conditional statements and loops in Python.

Outline
Conditional Statements

Loops

Project: Number Guessing Game

Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute specific code blocks based on certain conditions. This is essential for decision-making in your programs. In Python, the main conditional statements are if, elif, and else.

If Statement
The if statement allows you to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

Example: Deciding What to Wear Based on Weather

Imagine you are deciding what to wear based on the temperature:

python

Copy code

temperature = 25

  

if temperature > 20:

print("Wear shorts!") # Output: Wear shorts!
Explanation: If the temperature is greater than 20 degrees, the program prints "Wear shorts!". If the condition is not true, it does nothing.

Elif Statement
The elif (short for else if) statement allows you to check multiple conditions. It runs if the previous conditions were not true.

Example: Assigning Grades Based on Score

Think of grading students based on their scores:

python

Copy code

score = 85

  

if score >= 90:

print("Grade: A")

elif score >= 80:

print("Grade: B") # Output: Grade: B

elif score >= 70:

print("Grade: C")

else:

print("Grade: F")
Explanation: This example evaluates the score and assigns a grade. If the score is 85, it falls in the range for a Grade B. If the score doesn't meet the condition of the if statement, it checks the elif statements in order.

Else Statement
The else statement runs if none of the previous conditions were true.

Example: Checking If a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero

python

Copy code

number = -5

  

if number > 0:

print("The number is positive.")

elif number == 0:

print("The number is zero.")

else:

print("The number is negative.") # Output: The number is negative.
Explanation: This example checks if a number is positive, zero, or negative. If the number is not greater than 0 and not equal to 0, it must be negative.

Nested If Statements
You can nest if statements within each other to create more complex conditions.

Example: Age and Driving Eligibility

Imagine checking if someone is eligible for a driving license:

python

Copy code

age = 19

  

if age >= 18:

print("You are eligible for a driving license.")

if age >= 21:

print("You are also eligible to rent a car.")

else:

print("But you are not eligible to rent a car.") # Output: You are eligible for a driving license. \n But you are not eligible to rent a car.

else:

print("You are not eligible for a driving license.")
Explanation: This example checks if the person is old enough to get a driving license. If they are, it further checks if they are old enough to rent a car.

Loops
Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. In Python, the main loops are whileand for.

While Loop
The while loop executes as long as a condition is true.

Example: Counting Sheep

Imagine you are counting sheep to fall asleep:

python

Copy code

count = 1

  

while count <= 5:

print(f"Sheep {count}...") # Output: Sheep 1... \n Sheep 2... \n Sheep 3... \n Sheep 4... \n Sheep 5...

count += 1 # Increment count by 1
Explanation: This example uses a while loop to count sheep. The loop continues as long as the count is less than or equal to 5. Inside the loop, the count is incremented by 1 each time it runs.

For Loop
The for loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and executes the block of code for each item in the sequence.

Example: Listing Favorite Fruits

Imagine you are listing your favorite fruits:

python

Copy code

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  

for fruit in fruits:

print(f"I love {fruit}!") # Output: I love apple! \n I love banana! \n I love cherry!
Explanation: This example uses a for loop to iterate over a list of fruits. The loop runs once for each fruit in the list, printing a statement each time.

Range Function
The range() function generates a sequence of numbers, which is useful for loops.

Example: Printing Numbers in a Range

python

Copy code

Using range in a for loop
for i in range(5):

print(i) # Output: 0 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4
Specifying start, stop, and step
for i in range(1, 10, 2):

print(i) # Output: 1 \n 3 \n 5 \n 7 \n 9
Explanation:

The first loop uses range(5), which generates numbers from 0 to 4.

The second loop uses range(1, 10, 2), which generates numbers from 1 to 9, incrementing by 2 each time (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

Break and Continue Statements
The break statement exits the loop prematurely, while the continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

Break Example: Stopping at a Certain Number

python

Copy code

for i in range(10):

if i == 5:

break

print(i) # Output: 0 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4
Explanation: This example uses a for loop to print numbers. The loop stops when i equals 5 because of the breakstatement.

Continue Example: Skipping Even Numbers

python

Copy code

for i in range(10):

if i % 2 == 0:

continue

print(i) # Output: 1 \n 3 \n 5 \n 7 \n 9
Explanation: This example uses a for loop to print numbers from 0 to 9. The continue statement skips the print statement for even numbers, so only odd numbers are printed.

Project: Number Guessing Game
Project Description
We'll create a number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The game will provide feedback if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Generate a random number between 1 and 100.

Prompt the user to guess the number.

Provide feedback if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.

Repeat until the user guesses the correct number.

Code Example
python

Copy code

import random

Number Guessing Game
Generate a random number between 1 and 100
number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

attempts = 0

  

print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")

print("Guess a number between 1 and 100.")
Game loop
while True:

user_guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))

attempts += 1

  

if user_guess < number_to_guess:

print("Too low! Try again.")

elif user_guess > number_to_guess:

print("Too high! Try again.")

else:

print(f"Congratulations! You've guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.")

break
Explanation
We use the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.

The game loop continues to prompt the user for a guess until the correct number is guessed.

Each guess is compared to the randomly generated number, and feedback is provided to guide the user.

Summary
Today, we've covered:

Conditional Statements: if, elif, and else to control the flow of execution based on conditions.

Loops: while and for loops to execute code repeatedly.

Range Function: To generate sequences of numbers.

Break and Continue Statements: To control loop execution.

Project: Created a number guessing game to apply these concepts.

Tomorrow, we'll dive into functions and modules, learning how to organize and reuse code efficiently. We'll also refactor our simple calculator project to use functions.

Feel free to ask any questions you might have or discuss any issues you faced today. See you tomorrow!

USES:
Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used in various real-life situations where decisions need to be made based on certain conditions.

Example 1: ATM Withdrawal
Situation: A user wants to withdraw money from an ATM.

python

Copy code

balance = 500 # User's account balance

withdraw_amount = 100 # Amount user wants to withdraw

  

if withdraw_amount <= balance:

balance -= withdraw_amount

print("Withdrawal successful!")

print(f"Remaining balance: ${balance}")

else:

print("Insufficient funds!")
Explanation: This code checks if the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the balance. If true, it deducts the amount from the balance and confirms the transaction. Otherwise, it notifies the user of insufficient funds.

Example 2: Online Shopping Cart
Situation: Calculating the total price of items in an online shopping cart and applying a discount if the total exceeds a certain amount.

python

Copy code

total_price = 120 # Total price of items in the cart

  

if total_price > 100:

discount = total_price * 0.1 # 10% discount

total_price -= discount

print(f"Discount applied! Your new total is: ${total_price}")

else:

print(f"Your total is: ${total_price}")
Explanation: This code checks if the total price is greater than $100. If true, it applies a 10% discount. Otherwise, it prints the total price without any discount.

Example 3: Voting Eligibility
Situation: Checking if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

python

Copy code

age = 20 # Person's age

  

if age >= 18:

print("You are eligible to vote.")

else:

print("You are not eligible to vote.")
Explanation: This code checks if the personâs age is 18 or above. If true, it confirms their eligibility to vote. Otherwise, it informs them that they are not eligible.

Loops
Loops are used in scenarios where repetitive tasks need to be performed. They help automate processes that would otherwise be tedious and error-prone.

Example 1: Sending Emails to Multiple Recipients
Situation: Sending promotional emails to a list of recipients.

python

Copy code

recipients = ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com", "charlie@example.com"]

  

for recipient in recipients:

print(f"Sending email to {recipient}...")
Code to send email
print(f"Email sent to {recipient}")
Explanation: This code iterates over a list of email recipients and simulates sending an email to each one.

Example 2: Processing Sensor Data
Situation: Reading temperature data from sensors and triggering alerts if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold.

python

Copy code

sensor_data = [22, 24, 19, 30, 28, 35, 18]

  

for temperature in sensor_data:

print(f"Current temperature: {temperature}Â°C")

if temperature > 30:

print("Alert! Temperature too high!")
Explanation: This code iterates over a list of temperature readings and prints each one. If a reading exceeds 30Â°C, it triggers an alert.

Example 3: Calculating Average Exam Score
Situation: Calculating the average score of students in an exam.

python

Copy code

scores = [88, 76, 92, 85, 69]

  

total_score = 0

for score in scores:

total_score += score

  

average_score = total_score / len(scores)

print(f"The average score is: {average_score}")
Explanation: This code iterates over a list of exam scores, sums them up, and calculates the average score.

Project: To-Do List Application
Situation: Managing tasks in a to-do list application.

Adding Tasks: Using a loop to repeatedly prompt the user to add tasks until they decide to stop.

python

Copy code

tasks = []

  

while True:

task = input("Enter a new task (or type 'done' to finish): ")

if task.lower() == 'done':

break

tasks.append(task)

  

print("Your tasks are:")

for task in tasks:

print(f"- {task}")
Explanation: This code uses a while loop to continuously prompt the user to enter tasks. The loop breaks when the user types 'done'. It then prints all the tasks using a for loop.

Marking Tasks as Done: Using conditional statements to mark tasks as done.

python

Copy code

completed_tasks = []

  

for task in tasks:

mark_done = input(f"Did you complete the task '{task}'? (yes/no): ")

if mark_done.lower() == 'yes':

completed_tasks.append(task)

  

print("Completed tasks:")

for task in completed_tasks:

print(f"- {task}")
Explanation: This code iterates over the list of tasks and asks the user if they have completed each task. If the user answers 'yes', the task is added to the completed tasks list.

Summary
Real-life situations and projects where conditional statements and loops are used include:

Conditional Statements:

ATM withdrawal process

Online shopping cart discount application

Voting eligibility check

Loops:

Sending emails to multiple recipients

Processing sensor data for alerts

Calculating average exam scores

Project Example: To-Do List Application for managing tasks and marking them as done.

By understanding these examples, you can see how conditional statements and loops are essential tools in automating decisions and repetitive tasks in various real-life applications. Feel free to ask any questions or discuss any issues you faced today. See you tomorrow for our session on functions and modules!

Day 3: Functions and Modules
Introduction
Functions and modules are essential concepts in Python that help you organize and reuse code. Functions allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks, while modules help you organize related functions, classes, and variables into separate files.

Functions
Defining and Calling Functions
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. You define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. You call a function by using its name followed by parentheses.

Example: Greeting Function

python

Copy code

def greet():

print("Hello, world!")

  

greet() # Output: Hello, world!
Explanation: This example defines a function greet that prints a greeting message. The function is then called, which executes the code inside the function.

Function Arguments
Functions can take arguments (also known as parameters) to provide input values. These arguments are specified inside the parentheses during the function definition.

Example: Personalized Greeting

python

Copy code

def greet(name):

print(f"Hello, {name}!")

  

greet("Alice") # Output: Hello, Alice!

greet("Bob") # Output: Hello, Bob!
Explanation: This example defines a function greet that takes one argument, name, and prints a personalized greeting. The function is called twice with different names.

Default Arguments
You can provide default values for function arguments. If the caller does not provide a value for the argument, the default value is used.

Example: Greeting with Default Name

python

Copy code

def greet(name="world"):

print(f"Hello, {name}!")

  

greet() # Output: Hello, world!

greet("Alice") # Output: Hello, Alice!
Explanation: This example defines a function greet with a default argument name set to "world". If no argument is provided, the function uses the default value.

Return Values
Functions can return values using the return statement. The returned value can be stored in a variable or used directly.

Example: Adding Two Numbers

python

Copy code

def add(a, b):

return a + b

  

result = add(3, 5)

print(result) # Output: 8
Explanation: This example defines a function add that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. The returned value is stored in the variable result and printed.

Multiple Return Values
Functions can return multiple values by using tuples.

Example: Basic Arithmetic Operations

python

Copy code

def arithmetic_operations(a, b):

return a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b

  

add, subtract, multiply, divide = arithmetic_operations(10, 2)

print(f"Add: {add}, Subtract: {subtract}, Multiply: {multiply}, Divide: {divide}")
Output: Add: 12, Subtract: 8, Multiply: 20, Divide: 5.0
Explanation: This example defines a function arithmetic_operations that performs basic arithmetic operations and returns the results. The returned values are unpacked into separate variables and printed.

Modules
Modules are files containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. You can import modules to reuse their code in other programs.

Creating and Importing Modules
To create a module, save your Python code in a file with a .py extension. You can then import this module into other files using the import statement.

Example: Creating a Module

Create a file named my_module.py with the following content:
python
Copy code

def greet(name):

print(f"Hello, {name}!")

  

def add(a, b):

return a + b

1.    
    

Create another file named main.py and import my_module:  
python  
Copy code  
import my_module

  

my_module.greet("Alice") # Output: Hello, Alice!

result = my_module.add(3, 5)

print(result) # Output: 8
Explanation: This example creates a module my_module with two functions, greet and add. The module is then imported in main.py, and its functions are called.

Using Built-in Modules
Python comes with a standard library of built-in modules that provide various functionalities. You can import and use these modules in your programs.

Example: Using the math Module

python

Copy code

import math

  

number = 16

square_root = math.sqrt(number)

print(f"The square root of {number} is {square_root}") # Output: The square root of 16 is 4.0
Explanation: This example imports the built-in math module and uses its sqrt function to calculate the square root of a number.

Example: Using the random Module

python

Copy code

import random

  

random_number = random.randint(1, 100)

print(f"Random number between 1 and 100: {random_number}")
Explanation: This example imports the built-in random module and uses its randint function to generate a random number between 1 and 100.

Project: Refactor Calculator with Functions
Project Description
We'll refactor the simple calculator project from Day 1 to use functions for each arithmetic operation. This will make the code more organized and reusable.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Define functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Modify the main code to use these functions.

Code Example
python

Copy code

Define functions for arithmetic operations
def add(x, y):

return x + y

  

def subtract(x, y):

return x - y

  

def multiply(x, y):

return x * y

  

def divide(x, y):

if y != 0:

return x / y

else:

return "Error! Division by zero."
Main code
while True:

print("\nSelect operation:")

print("1. Add")

print("2. Subtract")

print("3. Multiply")

print("4. Divide")

print("5. Quit")

  

choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4/5): ")

  

if choice == '5':

break

  

if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))

num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

  

if choice == '1':

print(f"The result is: {add(num1, num2)}")

elif choice == '2':

print(f"The result is: {subtract(num1, num2)}")

elif choice == '3':

print(f"The result is: {multiply(num1, num2)}")

elif choice == '4':

print(f"The result is: {divide(num1, num2)}")

else:

print("Invalid input")
Explanation: This code refactors the simple calculator project by defining separate functions for each arithmetic operation. The main code uses these functions to perform calculations based on user input.

Summary
Today, we've covered:

Functions: How to define and call functions, use arguments and return values, and handle multiple return values.

Modules: How to create and import modules, and use built-in modules for additional functionality.

Project: Refactored the simple calculator project to use functions, making the code more organized and reusable.

Tomorrow, we'll explore data structures and file handling. We'll learn how to work with lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, and how to read from and write to files. We'll also build a contact book project to apply these concepts.

Feel free to ask any questions you might have or discuss any issues you faced today. See you tomorrow!

[python]: Absolutely! Let's move on to Day 4, where we'll explore data structures and file handling. We'll explain each item extensively with relatable examples and build a contact book project to apply these concepts.

Day 4: Data Structures and File Handling
Introduction
Data structures allow you to store and organize data efficiently, while file handling lets you read from and write to files. Today, we'll cover lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, and basic file operations.

Outline
Data Structures
Lists

Dictionaries

Sets

Tuples

File Handling
Reading from files

Writing to files

Project: Contact Book
Data Structures
Lists
A list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. Lists are defined using square brackets.

Example: Grocery List

# Define a list

grocery_list = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]

  

# Accessing items

print(grocery_list[0]) # Output: milk

  

# Modifying items

grocery_list[1] = "cheese"

print(grocery_list) # Output: ['milk', 'cheese', 'bread']

  

# Adding items

grocery_list.append("butter")

print(grocery_list) # Output: ['milk', 'cheese', 'bread', 'butter']

  

# Removing items

grocery_list.remove("bread")

print(grocery_list) # Output: ['milk', 'cheese', 'butter']
Dictionaries
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are unordered, changeable, and indexed.

Example: Student Grades

# Define a dictionary

grades = {"Alice": 90, "Bob": 85, "Charlie": 92}

  

# Accessing items

print(grades["Alice"]) # Output: 90

  

# Modifying items

grades["Bob"] = 88

print(grades) # Output: {'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 88, 'Charlie': 92}

  

# Adding items

grades["Dave"] = 95

print(grades) # Output: {'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 88, 'Charlie': 92, 'Dave': 95}

  

# Removing items

del grades["Charlie"]

print(grades) # Output: {'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 88, 'Dave': 95}
Sets
A set is a collection of unique items that are unordered and unindexed. Sets are defined using curly braces.

Example: Unique Colors

# Define a set

colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}

  

# Adding items

colors.add("yellow")

print(colors) # Output: {'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'}

  

# Removing items

colors.remove("green")

print(colors) # Output: {'red', 'blue', 'yellow'}
Tuples
A tuple is a collection of items that are ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are defined using parentheses.

Example: Coordinates

# Define a tuple

coordinates = (10, 20)

  

# Accessing items

print(coordinates[0]) # Output: 10

  

# Tuples are immutable, so you cannot modify items directly

# However, you can create a new tuple with modified values

new_coordinates = (coordinates[0], 30)

print(new_coordinates) # Output: (10, 30)
File Handling
File handling allows you to read from and write to files. Python provides built-in functions to handle file operations.

Reading from Files
To read from a file, you open the file in read mode and use the read() method.

Example: Reading a File

# Open a file in read mode

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:

content = file.read()

print(content)
Explanation: This example opens a file named example.txt in read mode and prints its content.

Writing to Files
To write to a file, you open the file in write mode and use the write() method.

Example: Writing to a File

# Open a file in write mode

with open("example.txt", "w") as file:

file.write("Hello, world!")

  

# Open the file again to check its content

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:

content = file.read()

print(content) # Output: Hello, world!
Explanation: This example opens a file named example.txt in write mode and writes "Hello, world!" to it. It then opens the file again in read mode to print its content.

Appending to Files
To append to a file, you open the file in append mode and use the write() method.

Example: Appending to a File

# Open a file in append mode

with open("example.txt", "a") as file:

file.write("\nAppend this line.")

  

# Open the file again to check its content

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:

content = file.read()

print(content)

# Output: Hello, world!

# Append this line.
Explanation: This example opens a file named example.txt in append mode and writes a new line to it. It then opens the file again in read mode to print its updated content.

Project: Contact Book
Project Description
We'll create a simple contact book that allows users to add, view, and search contacts. The contacts will be stored in a file, so they persist between program runs.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Create functions to add, view, and search contacts.

Use file handling to store and retrieve contacts.

Code Example
import json

  

# Define file path for storing contacts

file_path = "contacts.json"

  

# Function to load contacts from file

def load_contacts():

try:

with open(file_path, "r") as file:

return json.load(file)

except FileNotFoundError:

return {}

  

# Function to save contacts to file

def save_contacts(contacts):

with open(file_path, "w") as file:

json.dump(contacts, file)

  

# Function to add a contact

def add_contact(name, phone):

contacts = load_contacts()

contacts[name] = phone

save_contacts(contacts)

print(f"Contact {name} added successfully.")

  

# Function to view contacts

def view_contacts():

contacts = load_contacts()

if contacts:

for name, phone in contacts.items():

print(f"Name: {name}, Phone: {phone}")

else:

print("No contacts found.")

  

# Function to search for a contact

def search_contact(name):

contacts = load_contacts()

if name in contacts:

print(f"Found: {name} - {contacts[name]}")

else:

print(f"Contact {name} not found.")

  

# Main code

while True:

print("\nContact Book Menu")

print("1. Add Contact")

print("2. View Contacts")

print("3. Search Contact")

print("4. Quit")

choice = input("Choose an option: ")

  

if choice == '4':

break

elif choice == '1':

name = input("Enter name: ")

phone = input("Enter phone number: ")

add_contact(name, phone)

elif choice == '2':

view_contacts()

elif choice == '3':

name = input("Enter name to search: ")

search_contact(name)

else:

print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
Explanation
File Handling with JSON: We use the json module to store and retrieve contacts in a file. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write.

Functions:

load_contacts(): Loads contacts from the file.

save_contacts(contacts): Saves contacts to the file.

add_contact(name, phone): Adds a new contact and saves it.

view_contacts(): Displays all contacts.

search_contact(name): Searches for a contact by name.

Main Code: The main code provides a menu for the user to interact with the contact book. It uses a while loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to quit.
Summary
Today, we've covered:

Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, and how to use them to store and organize data.

File Handling: Reading from and writing to files, and how to use JSON for data storage.

Project: Created a contact book application to manage contacts using functions and file handling.

Tomorrow, we'll explore object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. We'll also build a simple bank account system to apply these concepts.

Feel free to ask any questions you might have or discuss any issues you faced today. See you tomorrow!

[python]: Great! Let's move on to Day 5, where we'll explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. We'll explain each item extensively with relatable examples and build a simple bank account system to apply these concepts.

Day 5: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize and manage code. OOP concepts help you structure your code in a more modular, reusable, and scalable way.

Outline
Classes and Objects

Attributes and Methods

Inheritance and Polymorphism

Project: Simple Bank Account System

Classes and Objects
Classes
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class can have.

Example: Defining a Class

class Dog:

# Class attribute

species = "Canis familiaris"

  

# Initializer / Instance attributes

def __init__(self, name, age):

self.name = name

self.age = age

  

# Instance method

def description(self):

return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

  

# Another instance method

def speak(self, sound):

return f"{self.name} says {sound}"
Explanation: This example defines a Dog class with a class attribute species, instance attributes name and age, and instance methods description and speak.

Objects
An object is an instance of a class. You create an object by calling the class.

Example: Creating Objects

# Create a new Dog object

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

  

# Accessing instance attributes

print(my_dog.name) # Output: Buddy

print(my_dog.age) # Output: 3

  

# Calling instance methods

print(my_dog.description()) # Output: Buddy is 3 years old

print(my_dog.speak("Woof")) # Output: Buddy says Woof
Explanation: This example creates an object my_dog of the Dog class and accesses its attributes and methods.

Attributes and Methods
Attributes
Attributes are variables that belong to a class or an object. There are two types of attributes: class attributes and instance attributes.

Class Attributes

Class attributes are shared by all instances of the class.

Example: Class Attributes

class Car:

# Class attribute

wheels = 4
Instance Attributes

Instance attributes are unique to each instance.

Example: Instance Attributes

class Car:

def __init__(self, color, model):

self.color = color

self.model = model
Methods
Methods are functions that belong to a class. There are three types of methods: instance methods, class methods, and static methods.

Instance Methods

Instance methods operate on an instance of the class.

Example: Instance Methods

class Car:

def __init__(self, color, model):

self.color = color

self.model = model

  

def description(self):

return f"The car is a {self.color} {self.model}"
Class Methods

Class methods operate on the class itself rather than on instances.

Example: Class Methods

class Car:

wheels = 4

  

@classmethod

def is_motor_vehicle(cls):

return True
Static Methods

Static methods do not operate on an instance or the class and are used to group related functions within a class.

Example: Static Methods

class Car:

@staticmethod

def honk():

return "Honk! Honk!"
Inheritance and Polymorphism
Inheritance
Inheritance allows you to define a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class. This helps in reusing code and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes.

Example: Inheritance

class Animal:

def __init__(self, name):

self.name = name

  

def speak(self):

raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")

  

class Dog(Animal):

def speak(self):

return f"{self.name} says Woof"

  

class Cat(Animal):

def speak(self):

return f"{self.name} says Meow"
Explanation: This example defines a base class Animal with a method speak. The Dog and Cat classes inherit from Animal and implement the speak method.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows you to use a unified interface for different data types. It enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

Example: Polymorphism

animals = [Dog("Buddy"), Cat("Whiskers")]

  

for animal in animals:

print(animal.speak())
Explanation: This example creates a list of Dog and Cat objects and calls the speak method on each, demonstrating polymorphism.

Project: Simple Bank Account System
Project Description
We'll create a simple bank account system that allows users to create accounts, deposit, and withdraw money. We'll use classes to represent the bank account and its operations.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Define a BankAccount class with attributes for the owner's name and balance.

Implement methods for depositing and withdrawing money.

Create instances of BankAccount and perform operations.

Code Example
class BankAccount:

def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):

self.owner = owner

self.balance = balance

  

def deposit(self, amount):

self.balance += amount

print(f"{amount} deposited. New balance is {self.balance}")

  

def withdraw(self, amount):

if amount <= self.balance:

self.balance -= amount

print(f"{amount} withdrawn. New balance is {self.balance}")

else:

print("Insufficient funds")

  

def get_balance(self):

return self.balance

  

# Creating an account

account = BankAccount("John Doe")

  

# Making transactions

account.deposit(1000)

account.withdraw(500)

account.withdraw(600)
Explanation
Class Definition: The BankAccount class has an initializer method to set the owner's name and balance.

Methods:

deposit(amount): Adds the amount to the balance and prints the new balance.

withdraw(amount): Subtracts the amount from the balance if there are sufficient funds and prints the new balance; otherwise, it prints an error message.

get_balance(): Returns the current balance.

Creating an Account: An instance of BankAccount is created for "John Doe" with an initial balance of 0.

Making Transactions: The deposit and withdraw methods are called to perform transactions on the account.

Summary
Today, we've covered:

Classes and Objects: How to define and use classes and objects in Python.

Attributes and Methods: Understanding class and instance attributes, and different types of methods.

Inheritance and Polymorphism: Using inheritance to reuse code and polymorphism to create a unified interface.

Project: Created a simple bank account system to apply OOP concepts.
